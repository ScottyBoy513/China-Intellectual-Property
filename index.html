  <p> Since 1979, China has acknowledged and protected intellectual property rights. Domestically, protection of intellectual property rights has been established by government legislature, administrative regulations, and decrees in trademark, copyright, and patents. China has been a part of the World's Intellectual Property Organization since 1980. It has patterned its intellectual property rights on the Bernes Convention for the protection of Literary Arts and Artistic Works adn the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of intellectual Property Rights. This means China has agreed to follow rules of Intellectual Property Rights based on what the rest of the world has set as its property rights.
